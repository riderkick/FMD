{ We need the NULL macro and size_t typedef.
  On an ANSI-conforming system it is sufficient to include <stddef.h>.
  Otherwise, we get them from <stdlib.h> or <stdio.h>; we may have to
  pull in <sys/types.h> as well.
  Note that the core JPEG library does not require <stdio.h>;
  only the default error handler and data source/destination modules do.
  But we must pull it in because of the references to FILE in jpeglib.h.
  You can remove those references if you want to compile without <stdio.h>.}



{ We need memory copying and zeroing functions, plus strncpy().
  ANSI and System V implementations declare these in <string.h>.
  BSD doesn't have the mem() functions, but it does have bcopy()/bzero().
  Some systems may declare memset and memcpy in <memory.h>.

  NOTE: we assume the size parameters to these functions are of type size_t.

  implementations out there, in which sizeof() returns an int even though
  size_t is defined as long or unsigned long.  To ensure consistent results
  we always use this SIZEOF() macro in place of using sizeof() directly. }
