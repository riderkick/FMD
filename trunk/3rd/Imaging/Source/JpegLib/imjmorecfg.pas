{ Ordering of RGB data in scanlines passed to or from the application.
  If your application wants to deal with data in the order B,G,R, just
  change these macros.  You can also deal with formats such as R,G,B,X
  (one extra byte per pixel) by changing RGB_PIXELSIZE.  Note that changing
  the offsets will also change the order in which colormap data is organized.
  RESTRICTIONS:
  1. The sample applications cjpeg,djpeg do NOT support modified RGB formats.
  2. These macros only affect RGB<=>YCbCr color conversion, so they are not
     useful if you are using JPEG color spaces other than YCbCr or grayscale.
  3. The color quantizer modules will not behave desirably if RGB_PIXELSIZE
     is not 3 (they don't understand about dummy color components!).  So you
     can't use color quantization if you change that value. }

  pre-ANSI compilers (because they insist on converting to double anyway).
  The code below therefore chooses float if we have ANSI-style prototypes. }
