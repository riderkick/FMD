{ The macro MAX_ALLOC_CHUNK designates the maximum number of bytes that may
  be requested in a single call to jpeg_get_large (and jpeg_get_small for that
  matter, but that case should never come into play).  This macro is needed
  to model the 64Kb-segment-size limit of far addressing on 80x86 machines.
  On those machines, we expect that jconfig.h will provide a proper value.
  On machines with 32-bit flat address spaces, any large constant may be used.

  NB: jmemmgr.c expects that MAX_ALLOC_CHUNK will be representable as type
  size_t and will be a multiple of sizeof(align_type). }

{ This routine computes the total space still available for allocation by
  jpeg_get_large.  If more space than this is needed, backing store will be
  used.  NOTE: any memory already allocated must not be counted.

  There is a minimum space requirement, corresponding to the minimum
  feasible buffer sizes; jmemmgr.c will request that much space even if
  jpeg_mem_available returns zero.  The maximum space needed, enough to hold
  all working storage in memory, is also passed in case it is useful.
  Finally, the total space already allocated is passed.  If no better
  method is available, cinfo^.mem^.max_memory_to_use - already_allocated
  is often a suitable calculation.

  It is OK for jpeg_mem_available to underestimate the space available
  (that'll just lead to more backing-store access than is really necessary).
  However, an overestimate will lead to failure.  Hence it's wise to subtract
  a slop factor from the true available space.  5% should be enough.

  On machines with lots of virtual memory, any large constant may be returned.
  Conversely, zero may be returned to always use the minimum amount of memory.}
