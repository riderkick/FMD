  This file contains application interface code for the compression half
  of the JPEG library.  These are the "standard" API routines that are
  used in the normal full-compression case.  They are not used by a
  transcoding-only application.  Note that if an application links in
  jpeg_start_compress, it will end up linking in the entire compressor.
  We thus must separate this file from jcapimin.c to avoid linking the
  whole compression library into a transcoder. }

  We require a write_all_tables parameter as a failsafe check when writing
  multiple datastreams from the same compression object.  Since prior runs
  will have left all the tables marked sent_table=TRUE, a subsequent run

  is wanted, but for safety's sake it should not be the default behavior:
  programmers should have to make a deliberate choice to emit abbreviated
  images.  Therefore the documentation and examples should encourage people
  to pass write_all_tables=TRUE; then it will take active thought to do the
  wrong thing. }
